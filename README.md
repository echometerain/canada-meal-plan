# Canada Meal Planner
Our submission to Recess Hacks 3.0 is this open-source meal-planning app established around the dietary guidelines provided by Health Canada. Canada Meal Planner stands at the **forefront** of your health journey, helping you become a better version of yourself. 

We strive to make **stress-free**, **accessible** healthy eating available to **everyone**, through our **user-friendly** interface and **intuitive** features. Users can enter their meals into a daily notebook, after which they receive a full macronutrient breakdown that details how much fat, protein, and carbohydrates they are consuming. 

Users can find inspiration through our leaderboard system, where they can engage in **friendly competitions** with their friends regarding their eating habits, and through our achievement system, which recognizes users for their remarkable efforts.
